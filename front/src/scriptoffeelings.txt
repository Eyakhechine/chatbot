happy
you are and this is great because nobody really cares if you re miserable
so you must as well be happy .




sad
you re feeling sad but sadness flies away on the wings of time;
Life is filled with challenges and obstacles that we need to tackle with tenacity and grit;
Sadness is also a kind of defense;
It s a natural part of life;
But sometimes it helps to know that others are going (or have been) through the same thing;
Because that means that things will get better, start looking up.


upset
Do not lose your inner peace for anything whatsoever, even if your whole world seems upset;
Never be in a hurry;
do everything quietly and in a calm spirit;
What is anything in life compared to peace of soul.

angry
but do not let your anger lead to hatred, as you will hurt yourself more than you would the other;
Anger makes you smaller, while forgiveness forces you to grow beyond what you were.
